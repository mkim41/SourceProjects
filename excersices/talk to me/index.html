            <p>Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Brown is such a nice color. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.</p>

            <p>Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Son of a gun. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. And maybe a little bush lives there.</p>
                
            <p>Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Don't fight it, use what happens. In your world you have total and absolute power. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.</p>
                
            <p>This piece of canvas is your world. Let's have a little bit of fun today. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.</p>
                
            <p>Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Just a little indication. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Here's another little happy bush.</p>
                
            <p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.</p>
                
            <p>How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.</p>
